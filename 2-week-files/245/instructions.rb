# Let's add more depth and functionality to our Song class

# Let's make it so that we can add tags to a song.

  # Start by adding an instance variable called @tags to the constructor that will can store a list of tags. (Hint - what data structure would be best for storing a list?)

  # Print out an instance of the Song class to see if the new attribute has been added.

# Can we write a method that adds tags?

  # Start by writing a method called add_tag that prints out "Hello from add_tag!"

  # This method will need to receive information. (How do you pass something into a method? ADD REFERENCE FROM PREWORK)

  # Now, let's take our instance variable and add the information we passed into the method. (What type of data structure is our instance variable? How do you add something to that type of data structure?)

  # Call the add_tag method and add in a new tag.

  # Print out the instance of the class to see if the tags are there.

# Play around with your code to see things working!
