# Let's print out the info for every song but only if the artist is Flogging Molly and they are a favorite!
# Write a loop that goes through the songs array and prints out each persons info.

  # We'll have to first print just the first item.
  # Next, call the info method on that item.
  # Let's do the same for the other two and note the pattern.
  # Wrap all of this is a loop and get ride of the redundant lines.
  # Replace the integer with your index variable

# Run your code and see it all working!

# Now let's only print when the artist is Flogging Molly and they are a favorite.

  # First, print out the info if the atrist is Flogging Molly.

  # Now, let's and in the && so that we can print if both are true

# Print your code to see it working! 

# Test your code by calling the favorite method before the loop to toggle the favorite attribute.

# Bonus - print out the song if it is Flogging Molly or a favorite
