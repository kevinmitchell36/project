# Let's make our program more complex by adding a new class that will work with our Song class

# Write a class called Playlist that has two attributes, @title and @songs. @title will be what you want to call the playlist (eg. "Jogging", "Relaxation", "Songs to bag your head to" ) and @songs will be an array of Song class instances

  # Start with writing a new Playlist class under your Song class
  
  # Add a constructor with your two attributes. @title should be an argument that is passed in and @songs should be an empty array.

# Next, we'll want to be able to see the values of @title and @songs so we'll need reader methods that return the values.

  # Write a method called title that return @titles.

  # Write a method called songs that returns @songs.

# Finally, let's add add a method that will allow us to add songs to the @songs array. 

  # Write a method called add_songs that prints "Hello from the add_song method!".

  # Have the method except an argument of a new_song

  # Inside the method, add your new_song to the @songs instance variable. (What data structure is @songs and how do I add to it?)

  # Call your method and add something to see that is it working

  # Add a new instance of the song class to your add_song method and see it working!
