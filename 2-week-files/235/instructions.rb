# Challenge problem - Add an array of tags to each song

# Let's keep it simple and add the same array to all songs
tags = ["pop", "upbeat", "relationships"]

# First, let's try this without a loop

# Grab the first item inside of songs and print. What data structure is it? How can I interact with this data structure?

# Add the key of "tags" and set it to an empty array. Print the result.

# Do the same thing with the other two positions and note the pattern.

# Let's wrap this inside of a loop and delete the unnecessary code. 

# What needs to be replaced inside of our loop?

# Run your code to see it working!
