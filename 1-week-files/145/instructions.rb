# Add a key value pair of "favorite" => false to each song in our playlist.

playlist = [
  {"title" => "Freak On A Leash", "artist" => "Korn", "lyrics" => "Something takes a part of me"},
  {"title" => "When Worlds Collide", "artist" => "Powerman 5000", "lyrics" => "What is really that motivates you?"},

# Let's begin by writing code that add the "favorite" => false key/value to the first item


  # Grab the first item


  # Add the key/value pair to that song


  # Grab the second item


  # Add the key/value pair to that song


  # Grab the third item


  # Add the key/value pair to that song


# Note the pattern and describe it



# Next, we should probably wrap this in a loop. Write a loop that prints out all the songs



# Let's see what happens when we place one of our "Add the key/value pair to that song" inside the loop we just wrote



# Make the necessary adjustment so that is works with all the item in the array



# Bonus - copy our above loop down here and add a conditional


  # Write a conditional that changes the value of the first "favorite" key to true if it is false


  # Let's make it work on all the items


# Add it to the loop we copied down.
