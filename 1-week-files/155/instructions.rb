# We are going to make our song class have a favorite attribute.


# Copy over your solution to 154.rb


# Let's add @favorite to the song class constructor and set a default of = false. This will not be passed in as an argument when we call our class.

  # Print out the song with the new favorite attribute (make sure to use pp instead of puts).



# We'll need to add the new method into our song class.

  # Write a method called toggle favorite that prints "Hello".

  # Call your method on your class to see it working.

# Let's turn our favorite program into a method that can toggle the @favorite value back and forth.

  # Borrow your code from the previous lesson and change it to make @favorite = true.

  # Run your code to see if the value was changed.

  # Now make it so that favorite can be changed back to false.

  # Bonus (will need research) - use a not(research this symbol -> (!)) to toggle the value.
