# Start with the below menu and write a program that asks the user to decide whether or not a song is their favorite.
puts "1. American Woman"
puts "2. Last Train To Clarksville"
puts "3. Ohio"
puts "4. Fortunate Son"
puts "5. For What It's Worth"

# First we'll create a variable that stores the user choice


 
# Next up, write a conditional that says "____ is your favorite!!!" if the user says "yes" (we'll fill in the blank with another puts).



# Let's also write a conditional that says "_____ is not your favorite..." if the user says "no" (we'll fill in the blank with another puts).



# We'll need to change our user input variable to always downcase the answer.



# Wrap your conditional in a while loop that runs 5 times.



# Copy everything down and test your code.
