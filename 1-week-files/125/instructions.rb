puts "3. Ohio"



# First, we'll need to gather user input and save it. Reminder: gets.chomp is not an integer by default.



# Next, let's write condition that prints something if the user types in 1.



# Now write a condition that prints something if the user types in 2.



# Let's have one more conditional that prints something if the user types in 3.



# Combine all three conditionals into one if/elsif/else (or if/elsif/elsif).



# Copy everything down and test your code.
